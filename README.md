# RA__ Project

## Overview

RA__ is a comprehensive project aimed at analyzing soil-water characteristics and optimizing parameters using various mathematical models. This project utilizes libraries such as Matplotlib, Plotly, SciPy, and Pandas to process data, perform optimizations, and visualize results.

## Features

- **Input Value Processing**: Parse and clean input values directly from Excel files.
- **Mathematical Modeling**: Implement complex mathematical formulas to compute water content, derivation, and pore radius.
- **Graphical Representation**: Generate interactive plots and graphs using Plotly to visualize soil-water characteristic curves and pore-size distributions.
- **Optimization**: Use optimization techniques to find the best-fit parameters for the models.

## Installation

To get started with RA__, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MukhtarSarsenbay/RA__.git
2. **Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
    cd RA__
   ```
3. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
      python3 -m venv env
      source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`.
```

4. **Install the dependencies:
  '''bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

##Usage
Run the Django development server:
```bash
  python manage.py runserver
  ```
**Access the application by navigating to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your web browser.
**Input your data through the provided web forms and generate the graphs and optimization results.
